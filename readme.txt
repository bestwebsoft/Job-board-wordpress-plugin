The plugin allows to create a job-board page on your site.

== Description ==

The plugin allows to create and post job-board posts as well as to change, sort and archive them. After inserting the short-code into the page, you will see all vacancies from a search form by categories, organizations, salary etc. The search form is available only after the user has been authorized as a candidate. The candidate is allowed to upload and submit a CV, select a category by which the list of vacant positions is formed for the last 24 hours and save the current search conditions to be used as a search template in future.
