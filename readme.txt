== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I create a vacancies page on my site? =

Just insert the shortcode [jbbrd_vacancy] into your page or post and save the settings on the settings page of the plugin. Attention: In order to avoid incorrect formatting of the text, the shortcode should be placed in text mode.

= How can I add a job offer on the vacancy page? =

Only administrator and the users with the role "employer" can manage job offers. Users with the role "employer" can view and sort all vacancies, as well as to create and edit their own. Roles are assigned by the administrator. The administrator can create, browse, sort, edit and delete any vacancies, CV, saved searches and search categories. Log in to your profile. Click "Vacancies" on the Panel, then click "Add vacancies". Fill in the fields, select the job category if it already exists, or create a new one. Fields marked with "*" are mandatory. Publish this vacancy by clicking on "Publish".

= How can I add a category of vacancies? =

To create or edit an existing category of vacancies, click on "Vacancies" on the admin panel, then click on the "Vacancy categories". Fill in the fields "Name", "Slug", "Description". Then add a new category by clicking on the "Add new vacancy category".

= How can I add my company`s logo to a job offer? =

Create a new vacancy, or press the "Edit" in existing one. Select "Featured Image / Set featured image". Upload an image and save the post. Recommended logo images for download are 150px by 100px.

= How can I place the login/registration form to add users with Employer and Job candidate roles? =

Insert the shortcode [jbbrd_registration] into your page or post. You can also add the login/registration form into the widget. To do it, just create a text widget and put the shortcode into the widget field. To prevent the login/registration errors, do not place more than one registration form shortcode on your website.

= Why I can't see the CV sort and send the form? =

Make sure that you have [Sender plugin](https://bestwebsoft.com/products/wordpress/plugins/sender/?k=ccd218c6d916f9735e3de54ff210e4fe) installed and activated. Register as a Job candidate to get the possibility to use a filter of vacancies and send CV.

= How can I send CV? =

Log in to your profile. In the user profile file, add CV (Doc, Docx, Pdf, Txt only). Click "Send CV" under the vacancy. The employer will receive an email with your details and a link to your CV attached file.

= Why I can't find a vacancy using a standard search form? =

Unlike standard posts, vacancies are custom post type and they are not included in the standard search form. To add a vacancy custom post type into your search, please install [Custom Search](https://bestwebsoft.com/products/wordpress/plugins/custom-search/?k=0320eef03b72c22f7448ab163f612a6d) plugin.

= What is the "archive of vacancies"? How to extract a vacancy from the archive of vacancies? =

Vacancies' validity is specified when entering a date in the "Expiry date" field. After reaching the specified date, vacancies are been automatically placed in the archive. Archive vacancies are not displayed in the front-end of the vacancies page, but they are preserved and always available for editing. You can remove the job from the archive. To do this, enter a new date in the "Expiry date" and click "Restore from archive". If you specify a wrong (already past) date in the "Expiry date", the vacancy will be available till the next archivation. You can set the time of daily archivation using the settings page of the plugin. If the field "Expiry date" is empty, the vacancy is considered to be constant.

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =
